## 🕵️‍♂️ Project Description

This repository contains a case study where we analyze customer preferences based on sales transaction data. The main goal is to group different types of customers and provide insights into what each group represents in terms of purchasing behavior. Special emphasis is placed on using the CTR (Click-Through Rate) column, which indicates the percentage of customers who viewed the ad, clicked on it, and made a purchase subsequently.

## 📌 Data Source

The data used in this project was randomly generated and represents sales transactions. The dataset provides valuable information about customer behavior, preferences, and their interaction with ads.

## 📌 Objectives

1. Analyze customer preferences based on their purchase transactions.
2. Group different types of customers using clustering techniques to identify similar behavior patterns.
3. Provide meaningful insights into each customer group and what they represent in terms of sales and engagement.
4. Use the CTR column as a key metric to understand the effectiveness of ads and their impact on customer purchasing decisions.

## 📌 Methodology and Tools

This project will employ category analysis, clustering, and data visualization techniques to achieve the aforementioned objectives. Tools such as Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib will be used for analysis and result presentation.
